This report is to understand mutual fund sales performance for client X and the industry, as well as to share some interesting findings along the road. The goal is to storytelling with the data and uncover actionable insights from the historical sales performance so that to steer the future investment, sales and fund distributions.

The analysis consists of two parts, part I focuses on the sales data regarding the mutual fund that client X produced, part II summerizes the stories for the overall industry mutual fund sales.

Additionally, I am particularly interested in the top performers in terms of brokers, fund categories, and cities/states, and I'm trying to answer questions such as who is the top performing broker that bought the most funds from client X and from the industry? What are the top 5 fund categories that this broker has invested in? etc.

##PART I : Client X Mutual Fund Sales Performance Analysis  

Data Preparation:  
A subset of the overall data (combined first file and second file) where "client x sales" has valid number that is greater than zero, i.e., rows indicating that brokers who have transaction with client x mutual fund

Here are the statistics showing the minimum, 1st quantile, median, mean, 3rd quantile and maximum numbers regarding client x mutual fund sales that each broker bought:

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#summary

statistics<-summary(clientx1$sum.clientx.sales)
#format(statistics, big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)
statistics
```

_Question?_ 

The Min number looks weird, how to explain a transaction having the amount $2? Is it a valid number? Who is conducting that transaction?  

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
clientx1[which(clientx1$sum.clientx.sales == 2),]

```

Who is conducting that transaction?  
* CSCA CAPITAL ADVISORS, LLC

 

####1.2 Scatterplot  

* An overview of the transaction performance for all the brokers who purchased client X mutual fund in Q1, 2013  
* Every point indicating a unique broker
* X axis refers to the count of transactions/sales of Client X mutual fund  
* Y axis refers to the total amount of sales of this broker
* In the following four plots, the difference is in the X axis scales (i.e. the number/count of transactions), which changes from 15,000 to 4,000 to 400 to 50. The hope is to zoom in the plot for an in-depth view over the clusters.
* The plot shows some brokers only conduct a few transactions but each transaction is having a large sales volume (> $5,000,000); whereas some others are buying very frequently with more than 30 times a quarter but each transaction amount is relatively small (< $250,000)

##Part II: Industry Mutual Fund Sales Performance Analysis 
  
  
Data Preparation:   
  
  
This part works on the combined datasets of first file and second file, looking at transactions on the industry mutual fund sales -- including client X fund.

###1. Overview of the industry mutual fund sales 
  
1.1 Statistical Six-Number Summary on Industry Fund Sales   

1.2 Negative Sales Number  

1.3 Importance and Popularity of Client X Fund in the Industry  

  
***

####1.1 Statistical Six-Number Summary on **Industry** Fund Sales  


```{r}
summary(data$total_sales)
```

  
From above, we saw some negative sales numbers, let's take a deeper look.  

    
####1.2 Negative Sales Number  
  

Interesting? questions ?   
There are 537 **total_sales** negative numbers. Potential explanation ?  
Here is a subset of the data showing negative total sales (limit 5 observations)

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#there are 537 sales are negative
negative<-subset(data, data$total_sales < 0)
head(negative, n=5)
```


####1.3 Importance and Popularity of Client X Fund in the Industry  


```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
group.t1<-group_by(data, broker_name)
total1 <-summarise(group.t1,
                    total.sales = sum(total_sales),
                    count.sales=n())
total1<-arrange (total1,broker_name)
total1<-total1[order(total1$total.sales,decreasing=T),]

#How many unique brokers only sell Client X Mutual Fund
dim(clientx1)[1]
#total number of unique brokers 
dim(total1)[1]


```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#clientx1$sum.clientx.sales<-as.numeric(clientx1$sum.clientx.sales)
#sum(clientx1$sum.clientx.sales)
#sum(clientx1$count.sales)
#total1$total.sales <- as.numeric(total1$total.sales)
#sum(total1$total.sales, na.rm = T)
#sum(total1$count.sales, na.rm = T)
```


* There are 346 unique brokers who purchased a total of $6,805,238,840 client X mutual fund with 79,551 transactions in Q1; whereas there are 1,603 brokers who bought all kinds of mutual funds (including client X funds) amounting a total of $43,241,014,613 during the same period, with 895,248 total count of transactions.
  
* Some Thoughts:
    + Popularity of client x mutual fund among all the brokers : 346/1603 = 21.58%
    + Total Sales Volume Percentage : $6,805,238,840/$43,241,014,613 = 15.73%
    + Transaction Percentage : 79,551/895,248 = 8.89%
